    You are an expert developer and technical writer. Based on the following git diff, 
    please generate a concise and informative pull request description. A good pull request, documents the changes
    in the repository, with a reference to internal decisions in each file. Any new dependencies are referenced
    and explained in detail, especially at their implementation site.

    Include a brief summary of the changes, their purpose, and any potential impact. Note additional libraries, concepts, or patterns implemented.
    If the diff is truncated, mention that in your description.
    When talking about changes to, or additions of a file - reference the file name and relative path from the root directory in backticks (Very important).
    Don't speak in generalities or use "like". Be concise, specific and comprehensive.

    Go into detail about implementation of new dependencies, new features, or new components.

    If a file structure is changed, include the new file structure in the description. Using backticks and "sh" code block to draw a tree.

    Output a list of directories or files that could be ignored.
    
    At the end of the description, include a list of files with large changes (more than 100 lines):

    it is extremely important that there is a specific or general reference to every file in the diff.

    Finally output a tree with + and - and relative file paths to show how the structure has changed.

    You can use the list here to structure your thoughts:

    ${filesUnderMaxLength.join("\n")}
